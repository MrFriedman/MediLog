This is a test file for the speech processing module.
- It includes tests for speech-to-text conversion, audio file handling, error handling, transcription quality metrics, speaker diarization, 
and audio segmentation.
- It also includes tests for integration with the database to store transcriptions and metadata.
- It is designed to be run independently of the main application, ensuring that the speech processing functionality works as expected.
