# This is where the speech processing logic is implemented.
'''
To Do:
- Implement speech-to-text conversion using a library like SpeechRecognition or Whisper.
- Implement audio file handling to process different formats (e.g., WAV, MP3).
- Implement error handling for audio processing.
- Implement transcription quality metrics (e.g., confidence score, noise level).
- Implement speaker diarization to identify different speakers in the audio.
- Implement audio segmentation to handle long recordings.
- Implement integration with the database to store transcriptions and metadata.
- Implement unit tests for the speech processing functions.   NOTE: This is optional for now, but should be considered in the future.

After this is done, we can move on to the next step of integrating the speech processing with the rest of the application.

NB: We need to categorise the data from the audio files into different categories such as medical records, prescriptions, and health metrics.
- Implement a function to categorize the data based on keywords or context.
- Store the categorized data in the appropriate database models.
- Implement a function to retrieve and display the categorized data in the application.
- Implement a function to update the categorized data based on new audio files or changes in the existing data.
- Implement a function to delete the categorized data if it is no longer needed.
- Implement a function to search for specific data within the categorized data.
- Implement a function to export the categorized data in a specific format (e.g., JSON, CSV).
- Implement a function to import categorized data from external sources.    NOTE: This is optional for now, but should be considered in the future.
